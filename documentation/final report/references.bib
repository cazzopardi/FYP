abstract = {The Internet and computer networks are exposed to an increasing number of security threats. With new types of attacks appearing continually, developing flexible and adaptive security oriented approaches is a severe challenge. In this context, anomaly-based network intrusion detection techniques are a valuable technology to protect target systems and networks against malicious activities. However, despite the variety of such methods described in the literature in recent years, security tools incorporating anomaly detection functionalities are just starting to appear, and several important problems remain to be solved. This paper begins with a review of the most well-known anomaly-based intrusion detection techniques. Then, available platforms, systems under development and research projects in the area are presented. Finally, we outline the main challenges to be dealt with for the wide scale deployment of anomaly-based intrusion detectors, with special emphasis on assessment issues.}

abstract = {There is an astounding growth in the adoption of machine learners (MLs) to craft intrusion detection systems (IDSs). These IDSs model the behavior of a target system during a training phase, making them able to detect attacks at runtime. Particularly, they can detect known attacks, whose information is available during training, at the cost of a very small number of false alarms, i.e., the detector suspects attacks but no attack is actually threatening the system. However, the attacks experienced at runtime will likely differ from those learned during training and thus will be unknown to the IDS. Consequently, the ability to detect unknown attacks becomes a relevant distinguishing factor for an IDS. This study aims to evaluate and quantify such ability by exercising multiple ML algorithms for IDSs. We apply 47 supervised, unsupervised, deep learning, and meta-learning algorithms in an experimental campaign embracing 11 attack datasets, and with a methodology that simulates the occurrence of unknown attacks. Detecting unknown attacks is not trivial: however, we show how unsupervised meta-learning algorithms have better detection capabilities of unknowns and may even outperform classification performance of other ML algorithms when dealing with unknown attacks.}

This article presents an overview of techniques for Nearest Neighbour classification focusing on: mechanisms for assessing similarity (distance), computational issues in identifying nearest neighbours, and mechanisms for reducing the dimension of the data.This article is the second edition of a paper previously published as a technical report [16]. Sections on similarity measures for time-series, retrieval speedup, and intrinsic dimensionality have been added. An Appendix is included, providing access to Python code for the key methods.},

The objectives of feature selection include building simpler and more comprehensible models, improving data-mining performance, and preparing clean, understandable data. The recent proliferation of big data has presented some substantial challenges and opportunities to feature selection. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive and structured overview of recent advances in feature selection research. Motivated by current challenges and opportunities in the era of big data, we revisit feature selection research from a data perspective and review representative feature selection algorithms for conventional data, structured data, heterogeneous data and streaming data. Methodologically, to emphasize the differences and similarities of most existing feature selection algorithms for conventional data, we categorize them into four main groups: similarity-based, information-theoretical-based, sparse-learning-based, and statistical-based methods. To facilitate and promote the research in this community, we also present an open source feature selection repository that consists of most of the popular feature selection algorithms (http://featureselection.asu.edu/). Also, we use it as an example to show how to evaluate feature selection algorithms. At the end of the survey, we present a discussion about some open problems and challenges that require more attention in future research.},

abstract = {The evolving unknown cyberattacks have rapidly expanded the cyber threat landscape. Identifying unknown cyberattacks, therefore, remains a challenging issue, compounded by the widespread implementation of emerging technologies, such as 5G, digital twin, etc. However, most existing intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are effective in detecting only known cyberattacks. In this paper, inspired by artificial immunity (AIm), we propose a hierarchical differential evolution based IDS, coined HiDE-IDS, to identify unknown cyberattacks. Specifically, we first map the multidimensional normal and abnormal network samples to self antigens and nonself antigens, respectively, in a multidimensional geometrical space. Second, a hierarchical differential evolution algorithm for self antigens is designed, to create newly-evolved antigens possibly used for generating cyberattack detectors. Third, a novel filtering mechanism is developed to eliminate invalid new antigens falling into the coverage of either known self or nonself antigens. Last, the remaining new antigens are employed to generate new detectors and further identify known and unknown cyberattacks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the training efficiency of the proposed HiDE-IDS is significantly improved than recent IDSs. More importantly, while showing a favorable false positive rate of normal data, the HiDE-IDS achieves outperformed effectiveness in recognizing unknown cyberattacks (as well as known cyberattacks) compared to the state-of-the-art studies.}

abstract = {The use of Machine Learning (ML) techniques for malware detection has been a trend in the last two decades. More recently, researchers started to investigate adversarial approaches to bypass these ML-based malware detectors. Adversarial attacks became so popular that a large Internet company has launched a public challenge to encourage researchers to bypass their (three) ML-based static malware detectors. Our research group teamed to participate in this challenge in August/2019, accomplishing the bypass of all 150 tests proposed by the company. To do so, we implemented an automatic exploitation method which moves the original malware binary sections to resources and includes new chunks of data to it to create adversarial samples that not only bypassed their ML detectors, but also real AV engines as well (with a lower detection rate than the original samples). In this paper, we detail our methodological approach to overcome the challenge and report our findings. With these results, we expect to contribute with the community and provide better understanding on ML-based detectors weaknesses. We also pinpoint future research directions toward the development of more robust malware detectors against adversarial machine learning.},

abstract="As an essential tool in security, the intrusion detection system bears the responsibility of the defense to network attacks performed by malicious traffic. Nowadays, with the help of machine learning algorithms, intrusion detection systems develop rapidly. However, the robustness of this system is questionable when it faces adversarial attacks. For the robustness of detection systems, more potential attack approaches are under research. In this paper, a framework of the generative adversarial networks, called IDSGAN, is proposed to generate the adversarial malicious traffic records aiming to attack intrusion detection systems by deceiving and evading the detection. Given that the internal structure and parameters of the detection system are unknown to attackers, the adversarial attack examples perform the black-box attacks against the detection system. IDSGAN leverages a generator to transform original malicious traffic records into adversarial malicious ones. A discriminator classifies traffic examples and dynamically learns the real-time black-box detection system. More significantly, the restricted modification mechanism is designed for the adversarial generation to preserve original attack functionalities of adversarial traffic records. The effectiveness of the model is indicated by attacking multiple algorithm-based detection models with different attack categories. The robustness is verified by changing the number of the modified features. A comparative experiment with adversarial attack baselines demonstrates the superiority of our model.",
